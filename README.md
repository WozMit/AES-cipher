# AES Cipher
A python script for Authenticated Encryption [AE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) with [AES](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) in [GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) mode of operation for data authenticity (integrity) and confidentiality. Key is obtained using the [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) [KDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) introduced in Percival's paper ["Stronger key derivation via sequential memory-hard functions"](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf).
